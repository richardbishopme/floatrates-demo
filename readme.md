## Floatrates Currency Calculator Demo

A small Laravel and Vue.js application using Bootstrap 4 for the UI. It converts currencies using the Floatrates Currency Exchange Rate feeds.

It's just a demo and not meant to be used in production. Feel free to use the code.

### Installation

Clone the project and run the scripts for the demo. No database migrations are needed

```bash
git clone git@github.com:richardbishopme/floatrates-demo.git
cd floatrates-demo && composer install
php artisan serve
```

The Vue.js and Bootstrap 4 files already come compiled (using Laravel Mix). However, if you would like to play with the files:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Have fun!
